# The curve25519-dalek crate is a dependency of solana-sdk.
# This crate relies on a specific version of zeroize that is incompatible with many other packages.
# You can find more details in this issue https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/26688
# Solana Labs has provided a solution for some of these package incompatibilities, which can be found here https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/27eff8408b7223bb3c4ab70523f8a8dca3ca6645/Cargo.toml#L514
